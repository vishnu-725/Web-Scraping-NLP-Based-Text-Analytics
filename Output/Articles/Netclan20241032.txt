Cloud-Based Data Modeling and Analysis Platform with Drag-and-Drop Interface and OpenAI API Integration for Simulation Insights

Client: A leading IT & tech firm in the USA Industry Type: IT Products & Services: IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaS Organization Size: 100+ Create a cloud-based solution where clients can upload datasets, use drag-and-drop functionality to select columns for data modeling, and receive the analysis results. The data analysis will be conducted using the OpenAI API, except for the mixed model, which will be handled manually. Then later user can do the simulation to get the insight of the dataset. Develop a web-based application using frameworks like React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Establish secure methods for database access and data handling. Initially, run statistical analyses using Python and update the interface with results including Mean AUC, Mean Accuracy, Mean Log-Likelihood, Coefficients with p-values, Intercept, BIC, AIC, Y_pred, Y_test, and X_test. Allow users to visualize the dataset with different charts, such as heatmaps, line charts, and actual vs. predicted values. Over time, automate these analyses by integrating Python scripts with the backend. Deploy the application on Google Cloud, ensuring the solution supports different user roles and permissions, with robust testing and scalable infrastructure. Provide features for users to perform simulations and gain insights based on the analysis results. Data Analysis Integration : Metrics and Results: Data Visualization : API Endpoints and Descriptions: 1- Generating R-code through ChatGPT and Executing it in the Back-end : 2- Prompt Engineering : 3- Mixed Model Handling : This is mainly used for healthcare field for data analysis enhancing decision-making efficiency and accuracy for users. https://test.aidprofit.com Summarized: https://blackcoffer.com/ This project was done by the Blackcoffer Team, a Global IT Consulting firm.
